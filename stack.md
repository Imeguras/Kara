## Context
So after researching a bit about UI toolkit, i decided to use it for my project as i am very used to CSS and i despise the "default/legacy" UI system Unity3D offers. 

Unfortunately it seems to be on a very early stage of development and they seem to be taking it in a "editor" GUI direction. Regardless i choose it as it made designing the UI way faster than i could ever do with the usual Unity3D UI method of doing things. 

## Objective
My objective is relatively simple, i want to create a behavior that updates the UI while hiding/abstracting this behavior(in other words i want to bind the value of the UI to some integer on a data class). 

_In the future this will be further complicated due to me slowly migrating everything to a multiplayer context but that's a problem for the future_
